DART Learn
=======================

The DART Learn is a a web-based online learning platform with learning modules based on the DART Curriculum. Each learning module will be dedicated to one topic of online deception. Our goal is to deliver a dynamic, interactive, and contextually meaningful learner-centered environment designed for older adults with their input.

This current iteration is for Xinhui's qualifier study testing.
